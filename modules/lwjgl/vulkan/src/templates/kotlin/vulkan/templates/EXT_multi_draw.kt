        Processing multiple draw commands in sequence incurs measurable overhead within drivers due to repeated state checks and updates during dispatch. This extension enables passing the entire sequence of draws directly to the driver in order to avoid any such overhead, using an array of ##VkMultiDrawInfoEXT or ##VkMultiDrawIndexedInfoEXT structs with {@code vkCmdDrawMultiEXT} or {@code vkCmdDrawMultiIndexedEXT}, respectively. These functions could be used any time multiple draw commands are being recorded without any state changes between them in order to maximize performance.

        <h5>C Specification</h5>
        To record an ordered sequence of draws which have no state changes between them, call:

        <pre><code>
￿void vkCmdDrawMultiEXT(
￿    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
￿    uint32_t                                    drawCount,
￿    const VkMultiDrawInfoEXT*                   pVertexInfo,

        <h5>Description</h5>
        The number of draws recorded is {@code drawCount}, with each draw reading, sequentially, a {@code firstVertex} and a {@code vertexCount} from {@code pVertexInfo}. For each recorded draw, primitives are assembled as for #CmdDraw(), and drawn {@code instanceCount} times with {@code instanceIndex} starting with {@code firstInstance} and sequentially for each instance.

        <h5>C Specification</h5>
        To record an ordered sequence of indexed draws which have no state changes between them, call:

        <pre><code>
￿void vkCmdDrawMultiIndexedEXT(
￿    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
￿    uint32_t                                    drawCount,
￿    const VkMultiDrawIndexedInfoEXT*            pIndexInfo,

￿    const int32_t*                              pVertexOffset);</code></pre>

        <h5>Description</h5>
        The number of draws recorded is {@code drawCount}, with each draw reading, sequentially, a {@code firstIndex} and an {@code indexCount} from {@code pIndexInfo}. For each recorded draw, primitives are assembled as for #CmdDrawIndexed(), and drawn {@code instanceCount} times with {@code instanceIndex} starting with {@code firstInstance} and sequentially for each instance. If {@code pVertexOffset} is {@code NULL}, a {@code vertexOffset} is also read from {@code pIndexInfo}, otherwise the value from dereferencing {@code pVertexOffset} is used.
