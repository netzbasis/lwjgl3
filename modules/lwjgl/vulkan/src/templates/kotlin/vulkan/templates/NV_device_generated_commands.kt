        """
        This extension allows the device to generate a number of critical graphics commands for command buffers.

        When rendering a large number of objects, the device can be leveraged to implement a number of critical functions, like updating matrices, or implementing occlusion culling, frustum culling, front to back sorting, etc. Implementing those on the device does not require any special extension, since an application is free to define its own data structures, and just process them using shaders.

        However, if the application desires to quickly kick off the rendering of the final stream of objects, then unextended Vulkan forces the application to read back the processed stream and issue graphics command from the host. For very large scenes, the synchronization overhead and cost to generate the command buffer can become the bottleneck. This extension allows an application to generate a device side stream of state changes and commands, and convert it efficiently into a command buffer without having to read it back to the host.

        Furthermore, it allows incremental changes to such command buffers by manipulating only partial sections of a command stream — for example pipeline bindings. Unextended Vulkan requires re-creation of entire command buffers in such a scenario, or updates synchronized on the host.

        The intended usage for this extension is for the application to:

        <ul>
            <li>create {@code VkBuffer} objects and retrieve physical addresses from them via #GetBufferDeviceAddressEXT()</li>
            <li>create a graphics pipeline using ##VkGraphicsPipelineShaderGroupsCreateInfoNV for the ability to change shaders on the device.</li>
            <li>create a {@code VkIndirectCommandsLayoutNV}, which lists the {@code VkIndirectCommandsTokenTypeNV} it wants to dynamically execute as an atomic command sequence. This step likely involves some internal device code compilation, since the intent is for the GPU to generate the command buffer in the pipeline.</li>
            <li>fill the input stream buffers with the data for each of the inputs it needs. Each input is an array that will be filled with token-dependent data.</li>
            <li>set up a preprocess {@code VkBuffer} that uses memory according to the information retrieved via #GetGeneratedCommandsMemoryRequirementsNV().</li>
            <li>optionally preprocess the generated content using #CmdPreprocessGeneratedCommandsNV(), for example on an asynchronous compute queue, or for the purpose of re-using the data in multiple executions.</li>
            <li>call #CmdExecuteGeneratedCommandsNV() to create and execute the actual device commands for all sequences based on the inputs provided.</li>
        </ul>

        For each draw in a sequence, the following can be specified:

        <ul>
            <li>a different shader group</li>
            <li>a number of vertex buffer bindings</li>
            <li>a different index buffer, with an optional dynamic offset and index type</li>
            <li>a number of different push constants</li>
            <li>a flag that encodes the primitive winding</li>
        </ul>

        While the GPU can be faster than a CPU to generate the commands, it will not happen asynchronously to the device, therefore the primary use case is generating “{@code less}” total work (occlusion culling, classification to use specialized shaders, etc.).
