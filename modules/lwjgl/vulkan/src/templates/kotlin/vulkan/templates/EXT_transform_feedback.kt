        """
        This extension adds transform feedback to the Vulkan API by exposing the SPIR-V {@code TransformFeedback} and {@code GeometryStreams} capabilities to capture vertex, tessellation or geometry shader outputs to one or more buffers. It adds API functionality to bind transform feedback buffers to capture the primitives emitted by the graphics pipeline from SPIR-V outputs decorated for transform feedback. The transform feedback capture can be paused and resumed by way of storing and retrieving a byte counter. The captured data can be drawn again where the vertex count is derived from the byte counter without CPU intervention. If the implementation is capable, a vertex stream other than zero can be rasterized.

        All these features are designed to match the full capabilities of OpenGL core transform feedback functionality and beyond. Many of the features are optional to allow base OpenGL ES GPUs to also implement this extension.

        The primary purpose of the functionality exposed by this extension is to support translation layers from other 3D APIs. This functionality is not considered forward looking, and is not expected to be promoted to a KHR extension or to core Vulkan. Unless this is needed for translation, it is recommended that developers use alternative techniques of using the GPU to process and capture vertex data.

        <h5>Description</h5>
        The {@code vkCmdBeginQueryIndexedEXT} command operates the same as the #CmdBeginQuery() command, except that it also accepts a query type specific {@code index} parameter.

        <h5>Description</h5>
        When the command is executed, primitives are assembled in the same way as done with #CmdDraw() except the {@code vertexCount} is calculated based on the byte count read from {@code counterBuffer} at offset {@code counterBufferOffset}. The assembled primitives execute the bound graphics pipeline.

        The effective {@code vertexCount} is calculated as follows:

        <pre><code>
￿const uint32_t * counterBufferPtr = (const uint8_t *)counterBuffer.address + counterBufferOffset;
￿vertexCount = floor(max(0, (*counterBufferPtr - counterOffset)) / vertexStride);</code></pre>

        The effective {@code firstVertex} is zero.

        <h5>Valid Usage</h5>
