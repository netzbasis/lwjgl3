            <li>#DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_AFTER_BIND_BIT indicates that if descriptors in this binding are updated between when the descriptor set is bound in a command buffer and when that command buffer is submitted to a queue, then the submission will use the most recently set descriptors for this binding and the updates do not invalidate the command buffer. Descriptor bindings created with this flag are also partially exempt from the external synchronization requirement in #UpdateDescriptorSetWithTemplateKHR() and #UpdateDescriptorSets(). Multiple descriptors with this flag set <b>can</b> be updated concurrently in different threads, though the same descriptor <b>must</b> not be updated concurrently by two threads. Descriptors with this flag set <b>can</b> be updated concurrently with the set being bound to a command buffer in another thread, but not concurrently with the set being reset or freed.</li>
            <li>#DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_PARTIALLY_BOUND_BIT indicates that descriptors in this binding that are not <em>dynamically used</em> need not contain valid descriptors at the time the descriptors are consumed. A descriptor is dynamically used if any shader invocation executes an instruction that performs any memory access using the descriptor. If a descriptor is not dynamically used, any resource referenced by the descriptor is not considered to be referenced during command execution.</li>
            <li>#DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_UNUSED_WHILE_PENDING_BIT indicates that descriptors in this binding <b>can</b> be updated after a command buffer has bound this descriptor set, or while a command buffer that uses this descriptor set is pending execution, as long as the descriptors that are updated are not used by those command buffers. Descriptor bindings created with this flag are also partially exempt from the external synchronization requirement in #UpdateDescriptorSetWithTemplateKHR() and #UpdateDescriptorSets() in the same way as for #DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_AFTER_BIND_BIT. If #DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_PARTIALLY_BOUND_BIT is also set, then descriptors <b>can</b> be updated as long as they are not dynamically used by any shader invocations. If #DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_PARTIALLY_BOUND_BIT is not set, then descriptors <b>can</b> be updated as long as they are not statically used by any shader invocations.</li>
            <li>#DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_VARIABLE_DESCRIPTOR_COUNT_BIT indicates that this is a <em>variable-sized descriptor binding</em> whose size will be specified when a descriptor set is allocated using this layout. The value of {@code descriptorCount} is treated as an upper bound on the size of the binding. This <b>must</b> only be used for the last binding in the descriptor set layout (i.e. the binding with the largest value of {@code binding}). For the purposes of counting against limits such as {@code maxDescriptorSet}* and {@code maxPerStageDescriptor}*, the full value of {@code descriptorCount} is counted, except for descriptor bindings with a descriptor type of #DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INLINE_UNIFORM_BLOCK, when ##VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo{@code ::flags} does not contain #DESCRIPTOR_SET_LAYOUT_CREATE_DESCRIPTOR_BUFFER_BIT_EXT. In this case, {@code descriptorCount} specifies the upper bound on the byte size of the binding; thus it counts against the <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html\#limits-maxInlineUniformBlockSize">{@code maxInlineUniformBlockSize}</a> and <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html\#limits-maxInlineUniformTotalSize">{@code maxInlineUniformTotalSize}</a> limits instead.</li>

        Note that while #DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_AFTER_BIND_BIT and #DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_UNUSED_WHILE_PENDING_BIT both involve updates to descriptor sets after they are bound, #DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_UNUSED_WHILE_PENDING_BIT is a weaker requirement since it is only about descriptors that are not used, whereas #DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_UPDATE_AFTER_BIND_BIT requires the implementation to observe updates to descriptors that are used.

        <h5>Description</h5>
        {@code vkCmdDrawIndirectCount} behaves similarly to #CmdDrawIndirect() except that the draw count is read by the device from a buffer during execution. The command will read an unsigned 32-bit integer from {@code countBuffer} located at {@code countBufferOffset} and use this as the draw count.

        {@code vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirectCount} behaves similarly to #CmdDrawIndexedIndirect() except that the draw count is read by the device from a buffer during execution. The command will read an unsigned 32-bit integer from {@code countBuffer} located at {@code countBufferOffset} and use this as the draw count.

        To wait for a set of semaphores created with a {@code VkSemaphoreType} of #SEMAPHORE_TYPE_TIMELINE to reach particular counter values on the host, call:

        <pre><code>
￿VkResult vkWaitSemaphores(
￿    VkDevice                                    device,
￿    const VkSemaphoreWaitInfo*                  pWaitInfo,
￿    uint64_t                                    timeout);</code></pre>

        or the equivalent command

        <pre><code>
￿VkResult vkWaitSemaphoresKHR(
￿    VkDevice                                    device,
￿    const VkSemaphoreWaitInfo*                  pWaitInfo,
￿    uint64_t                                    timeout);</code></pre>

        <h5>Description</h5>
        If the condition is satisfied when {@code vkWaitSemaphores} is called, then {@code vkWaitSemaphores} returns immediately. If the condition is not satisfied at the time {@code vkWaitSemaphores} is called, then {@code vkWaitSemaphores} will block and wait until the condition is satisfied or the {@code timeout} has expired, whichever is sooner.

        If {@code timeout} is zero, then {@code vkWaitSemaphores} does not wait, but simply returns information about the current state of the semaphores. #TIMEOUT will be returned in this case if the condition is not satisfied, even though no actual wait was performed.

        If the condition is satisfied before the {@code timeout} has expired, {@code vkWaitSemaphores} returns #SUCCESS. Otherwise, {@code vkWaitSemaphores} returns #TIMEOUT after the {@code timeout} has expired.

        If device loss occurs (see <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html\#devsandqueues-lost-device">Lost Device</a>) before the timeout has expired, {@code vkWaitSemaphores} <b>must</b> return in finite time with either #SUCCESS or #ERROR_DEVICE_LOST.

        Signal a timeline semaphore on the host.

        <h5>C Specification</h5>
        To signal a semaphore created with a {@code VkSemaphoreType} of #SEMAPHORE_TYPE_TIMELINE with a particular counter value, on the host, call:

        The first synchronization scope is defined by the host execution model, but includes execution of {@code vkSignalSemaphore} on the host and anything that happened-before it.

        The second synchronization scope is empty.

        <h5>Description</h5>
        The 64-bit return value is an address of the start of {@code pInfo→buffer}. The address range starting at this value and whose size is the size of the buffer <b>can</b> be used in a shader to access the memory bound to that buffer, using the {@code SPV_KHR_physical_storage_buffer} extension or the equivalent {@code SPV_EXT_physical_storage_buffer} extension and the {@code PhysicalStorageBuffer} storage class. For example, this value <b>can</b> be stored in a uniform buffer, and the shader <b>can</b> read the value from the uniform buffer and use it to do a dependent read/write to this buffer. A value of zero is reserved as a “{@code null}” pointer and <b>must</b> not be returned as a valid buffer device address. All loads, stores, and atomics in a shader through {@code PhysicalStorageBuffer} pointers <b>must</b> access addresses in the address range of some buffer.

        If the buffer was created with a non-zero value of ##VkBufferOpaqueCaptureAddressCreateInfo{@code ::opaqueCaptureAddress} or ##VkBufferDeviceAddressCreateInfoEXT{@code ::deviceAddress}, the return value will be the same address that was returned at capture time.

        The returned address <b>must</b> satisfy the alignment requirement specified by ##VkMemoryRequirements{@code ::alignment} for the buffer in ##VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo{@code ::buffer}.

        If multiple {@code VkBuffer} objects are bound to overlapping ranges of {@code VkDeviceMemory}, implementations <b>may</b> return address ranges which overlap. In this case, it is ambiguous which {@code VkBuffer} is associated with any given device address. For purposes of valid usage, if multiple {@code VkBuffer} objects <b>can</b> be attributed to a device address, a {@code VkBuffer} is selected such that valid usage passes, if it exists.
